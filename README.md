Decission Tree is an algorithm of Machine Learning.
Entropy=Entropy is the measure of the impurity or the uncertainty of the given attribute.
Gini=Gini used in both classification and regression. This index measures the impurity of the set of thaining tuples.
Pruning= Pruning in decision tree is the technique to reduce the complexity removing nodes or branches that dosen't contribute significantly to the overall accracy. It helps to prevent the overfitting.
Post_pruning=Allowing the tree to grow in depth then getting rid of various branches based on various critaris.
